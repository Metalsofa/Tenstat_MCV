This is meant to be (at least in early development) semi-advanced software.
Anyone comfortable with statistics and programming will have a field day with it.

Analysis objects: (all of these creatable, manipulable, readable, and analyzable by the user)
    Variables
        Categorical (unordered)
        Quantitative
            Discrete (ordered categorical)
                By nature
                By interval imposition
            Continuous
    Variable Web
        Shows all the variables and represents their 
        dependencies and other relationships as a bunch of cables and cords, like a web.
        Any time a data set relates two variables, a connection will appear there.
    Data structures
        Table
        Lists
        Vector
        Matrix
        Tensor
            Multidimensional Categorical Variable (MCV) Tensor
            Good for organizing and analyzing data sets with
                    Multiple Categorical (or Intervaled Quantitative) Variables (these are what make the MCV Tensor extrememly useful)
                    At least one Quantitative (discrete or continuous) variable
    Data sources (User can import/export these in multiple ways, and have multiple going at once
    for a given variable)
        CSV or ISV files - interpreted as tables or lists
    Parsing methods
        Let the user define, edit, and save different methods of parsing data sources or text files
        *It might be very good to have the software able to interpret multiple languages for this sort of thing
        Even include methods for user-customizable analysis of differernt type of files including:
            Video
            Audio
            Complex documents like reports, papers, court cases, etc.
        The user can delimit data from a source into multiple tables if it would be helpul (like that darned census data)
    Equations
        Let the user define equations like in Maple, so that they can have certian derived quantities and categories for the purpose of analyzing their data
    Indexes
        Let the user have indexes for different objects, so they can easily move between a labeled object and a numbered one if they want to. Think of it like the user being able to create refrence tables for themelves
        Also allows users to "rank" categorical variables if they want to
    Charts
        Different good-looking graphics and charts can be created by the user from their data and results
    Sorting algorithms
        If the software's built in sorting algorithms aren't enough, more can be programmed in
    Results
        The user can save the results of different analyses using the software in a way that is well-organized and lossless

Analysis methods: (The user can carry these out by clicking "new analysis")
    MCV Tensor - Intercorrelation Analysis
        -Intercorrelation matrices for a single categorical dimension (one matrix for this dimension, holding any given number of others constant)
        -Synthetic Proportionality - evaluate by 
        -Other types of intercategorical analysis that account for every single data entry in the the MCV Tensor
        -Interpret empty cells as... (0 or unknown/unavailable/NA)
