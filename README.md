# Tenstat_MCV
*Open-source statistical analysis software*
When we are faced with a large amount of data concerning many categorical and quantitative variables (possibly thousands at a time!) it can be very difficult to properly crunch those numbers and see the relationships between them without the right software -- and the right software often costs a lot of money to use! This is why I've started developing Tenstat, the Multi-Categorical Variable statistics software. It is named after the main data structure it uses for analysis, the Tensor. It can create a tensor of an arbitrary number of dimensions--this comes in handy when our categorical variables have hundereds or thousands of categories.
A lot of functionality has yet to be implemented--it still only runs in a terminal. This won't be the case forever though, so keep checking back for updates!
